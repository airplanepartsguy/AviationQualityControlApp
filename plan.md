# Aviation Quality Control App - Fast Track Development Plan

## **Project Status After Revert**
- **Current State**: Reverted to clean working version with solid photo functionality
- **Timeline**: Aggressive development - hours/days, not weeks
- **Architecture**: React Native Expo + Supabase backend
- **Core Working**: Photo capture and basic functionality operational

## **Fast Track Development Sprint (7 Days)**

### **Day 1: Foundation Assessment & Setup**
- [ ] Assess current working functionality in reverted version
- [ ] Document what's working vs what needs building
- [ ] Set up development environment and dependencies
- [ ] Create basic project structure for new features
- [ ] Test photo functionality to ensure it's stable

### **Day 2: Navigation & Core Pages**
- [ ] Design and implement main navigation structure
- [ ] Create essential screens/pages:
  - [ ] Dashboard/Home screen
  - [ ] Photo gallery/management screen
  - [ ] Settings screen
  - [ ] User profile screen
- [ ] Implement basic routing between screens
- [ ] Ensure consistent UI/UX across pages

### **Day 3: Local Database Architecture**
- [ ] Design local database schema for offline-first approach
- [ ] Implement local storage solution (SQLite/AsyncStorage)
- [ ] Create data models for:
  - [ ] Photo batches
  - [ ] User sessions
  - [ ] App settings
  - [ ] Sync queue
- [ ] Test local data persistence

### **Day 4: Supabase Integration & Sync**
- [ ] Set up Supabase client configuration
- [ ] Implement authentication with Supabase
- [ ] Create sync service for local-to-cloud data transfer
- [ ] Implement offline-first sync logic:
  - [ ] Queue system for offline operations
  - [ ] Conflict resolution strategy
  - [ ] Network status monitoring
- [ ] Test sync functionality

### **Day 5: Licensing System Foundation**
- [ ] Design licensing/user management system
- [ ] Implement basic user roles (admin/member)
- [ ] Create device registration system
- [ ] Add license validation logic
- [ ] Build admin interface for user management
- [ ] Test single-device enforcement

### **Day 6: Multi-Tenant & Business Logic**
- [ ] Implement company/organization structure
- [ ] Add data isolation between tenants
- [ ] Create batch management workflows
- [ ] Implement photo organization features
- [ ] Add basic reporting/analytics
- [ ] Test multi-tenant functionality

### **Day 7: Testing, Polish & Deployment Prep**
- [ ] Comprehensive testing of all features
- [ ] UI/UX polish and consistency check
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Deployment configuration
- [ ] Documentation updates

## **Technical Priorities**

### **Must Have (Core Features)**
1. **Photo Functionality**: Maintain existing working photo capture
2. **Navigation**: Clean, intuitive app navigation
3. **Local Storage**: Reliable offline data persistence
4. **Supabase Sync**: Robust cloud synchronization
5. **Basic Licensing**: Single-device user management

### **Should Have (Business Features)**
1. **Multi-Tenant**: Company data isolation
2. **Admin Interface**: User and license management
3. **Batch Management**: Photo organization workflows
4. **Offline Queue**: Reliable sync when connectivity returns

### **Could Have (Nice to Have)**
1. **Advanced Analytics**: Usage reporting
2. **Push Notifications**: Sync status updates
3. **Advanced UI**: Polished user experience
4. **Performance Optimization**: Speed improvements

## **Daily Success Criteria**

### **Day 1 Success**: 
- Clear understanding of current capabilities
- Development environment ready
- Photo functionality confirmed working

### **Day 2 Success**:
- Users can navigate between all main screens
- Basic UI consistency established
- Core app structure in place

### **Day 3 Success**:
- Local data storage working reliably
- Data persists between app sessions
- Basic CRUD operations functional

### **Day 4 Success**:
- Supabase authentication working
- Data syncs between local and cloud
- Offline/online modes functional

### **Day 5 Success**:
- Users can be created and managed
- Device licensing enforced
- Admin can control user access

### **Day 6 Success**:
- Multiple companies can use app independently
- Photo batches organized properly
- Business workflows functional

### **Day 7 Success**:
- App ready for production deployment
- All core features tested and working
- Documentation complete

## **Risk Management**

### **High Risk Items**
- **Photo functionality regression**: Test frequently during development
- **Sync complexity**: Keep sync logic simple initially
- **Performance issues**: Monitor app performance daily

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- **Daily testing**: Test core functionality every day
- **Incremental development**: Build in small, testable chunks
- **Rollback plan**: Keep working versions at each milestone

## **Success Metrics**

### **Technical Metrics**
- Photo capture works reliably
- App loads in <3 seconds
- Sync completes in <30 seconds
- No data loss during sync

### **Business Metrics**
- Single-device licensing enforced
- Multi-tenant data isolation working
- Admin can manage users effectively
- App ready for customer deployment

## **Daily Check-ins**

### **End of Day Review**
- What was completed today?
- What blockers were encountered?
- What's the plan for tomorrow?
- Are we on track for the 7-day timeline?

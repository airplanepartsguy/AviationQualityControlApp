# âœ… Fixed! Ready to Test Again

## What Was Wrong:
- BatchPreviewScreen had an incorrect service import
- Was trying to call a non-existent method

## What I Fixed:
1. âœ… Changed to use `erpSyncService` (the correct service)
2. âœ… Updated to call `syncBatchToErp()` method
3. âœ… Fixed all imports and exports

## Try This Now:

### 1. Refresh the App
Press `r` in the terminal or pull down to refresh in Expo Go

### 2. Open Batch #12 Again
- Go back to Dashboard
- Tap on the INV-357 batch (2 photos)

### 3. In Batch Preview Screen
You should now see:
- 2 photos displayed
- "Upload to ERP" button at bottom
- No more errors!

### 4. Tap "Upload to ERP"
Watch for:
1. "Preparing upload..." 
2. Token refresh (automatic)
3. "Generating PDF..."
4. "Uploading to Salesforce..."
5. "Successfully uploaded!" âœ…

### 5. Test Duplicate Prevention
- Wait 3 seconds
- Tap "Upload to ERP" again
- Should see: "Batch has already been uploaded to ERP"

## What to Look For in Logs:
- `[ErpSync] Starting sync for batch 12`
- `[SalesforceOAuth] Token expired, refreshing...`
- `[PDFGeneration] Generating PDF...`
- `[SalesforceUpload] Starting upload flow`
- `[ErpSync] Batch uploaded successfully`

The app should work perfectly now! ðŸš€

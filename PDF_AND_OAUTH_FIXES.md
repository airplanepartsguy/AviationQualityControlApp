# 🎯 PDF Overlay & OAuth Token Fixes

## ✅ **Fixed Issues**

### **1. PDF Overlay Removal** 📄
**Problem**: PDFs had header overlays showing "Page X of Y" on top of photos
**Solution**: 
- ✅ **Removed header overlay** from PDF generation
- ✅ **Removed CSS styles** for overlay positioning  
- ✅ **Changed image fit** from `cover` to `contain` (shows full photo without cropping)

**Before**: Photos had white overlay boxes with page numbers
**After**: Clean photos with no overlay, full image visible

### **2. OAuth Token Expiration Fix** 🔐
**Problem**: Forced re-authentication every **2 hours** (way too aggressive!)
**Solution**: Extended token lifetime to **12 hours**

**Changes Made**:
- `salesforceOAuthService.ts`: `2 hours` → `12 hours`
- `companyIntegrationsService.ts`: `2 hours` → `12 hours` 
- Added better logging to show token age in hours

**Before**: Re-authenticate every 2 hours
**After**: Re-authenticate only after 12 hours (more realistic for Salesforce tokens)

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

### **PDF Generation**:
- **Clean PDFs**: No more header overlays
- **Full photos**: Complete images without cropping
- **Professional output**: Just the photos, nothing else

### **OAuth Authentication**:
- **Less frequent re-auth**: Every 12 hours instead of 2 hours
- **Better logging**: Shows "Token still valid, age: X minutes"
- **More user-friendly**: Won't interrupt workflow constantly

## 🚀 **Ready to Test**
1. **Generate PDF** → Should see clean photos without overlays
2. **Use app for hours** → Should not ask for re-authentication constantly
3. **Check logs** → Should show token age and validity status

Both issues should now be resolved! 🎉
